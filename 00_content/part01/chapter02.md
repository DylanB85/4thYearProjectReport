## Introduction
People have always had to deal with illness in a variety of ways. But like all things in today's modern society, and throughout history,
everything evolves with technology and accessibility to medical care is now more convenient than ever. With the internet evolving in the way it has,
along with social media too, it has become easier and easier to access valuable information, be it through research conducted online, or just simply
by communicating with people through internet message boards, forums and social media. But with these advancements come negative implications too, a key example of this is
being people who self diagnose online. According to Srini Pillay M.D[11] "In this day and age of limited time with doctors coupled with
ample opportunity to Google anything, the temptation for people to reach their own conclusions about their illness is strong".
He goes on to say how when people self diagnose online they are assuming that they know the subtleties that a diagnosis constitutes.
He goes on to list the problems that can come with a self diagnosis. Some of the examples given are; self diagnosis in psychological syndromes, where
you miss a medical disease that "masquerades" as a psychiatric syndrome and if a typical user is to miss the subtleties that a diagnosis constitutes, they may also
miss the subtleties that come with the treatment of a diagnosis.

The purpose of this research is to show methods of treatments though exercises and therapy as conducted and researched by medical professionals and verified 
sources of information, this will be included in the final application to help users understand their illness better and be able to treat themselves as best they can
through exercise or other methods, leading to no self diagnosis on treatments of their illness being necessary. This is not only
beneficial for people with a physical illness, but also a mental illness.

## Review Of Literature


### Lung Cancer Exercise Program
Lung cancer is a very common form of cancer which effects both men and women in Ireland, with over 2300[12] people being diagnosed each year
according to the Irish Cancer Society. This is a disease which can often leave people horribly impaired and having trouble doing even simple tasks,
mainly due to issues with breathing. The journal which was researched to try and improve this is A Structured Exercise Program
for Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer[13], with research conducted by Jennifer S. Temel, MD, Joseph A. Greer, PhD,
Sarah Goldberg, MD, Paula Downes Vogel, PT, MS, Michael Sullivan, PT MBA, William F. Pirl, MD, Thomas J. Lynch, MD, David C. Christiani, MD
and Matthew R. Smith, MD, Phd.

The main research questions proposed by the authors in this paper is what hospital-based exercise program is feasible in dealing with patients
who have non-small cell lung cancer. The reasoning behind the research conducted in this paper is what exercise  can be proven to improve symptoms
for certain cancer populations, but it is unknown whether or not these exercises are feasible within lung cancer. For the methodology technique
used to accurately conduct this study, patients that were within 12 weeks of diagnosis were eligible to take part in it, while patients who had
any type of cardiac disease including congestive heart failure were deemed ineligible. The tests were carried out with a senior physical therapist and
vital signs of the patients were monitored/ These tests included a 6 minute walk test, in which the distance a patient could walk within a 6 minute
time period, along with a muscle strength exercise which included upper body exercises such as flexing of the shoulders, elbows and extending the elbows too.
Lower body exercises were also carried out these included hip extensions, hip abductions and knee extensions. These sessions would be carried out twice every week over
the course of two months.

According to the studies conducted in this paper, it was recorded that 25 of the patients who took part in this research, 80%
completed the initial evaluation. But overall only 44% of patients completed the exercise program due to progressions of the disease.
But those who were able to complete the study in full showed a significant reduction in lung cancer symptoms and had no record of deterioration in the 6 minute
walk test and and muscle strength test. Overall the research conducted was a success for the most part. While less than half of the patients who
initially signed up for the research were able to complete it in full, which could be argued that this brings into question the full validity of the
paper as these results could have potentially altered the final results of the paper as these patients showed the worst symptoms if the disease.
But on the other hand it could be argued that the research was successful as the other half of the patients showed no signs of deterioration due to the disease,
and actually showed an improvement in lung cancer symptoms. While an argument can be made for both sides that people showed signs of deterioration had no recognizable improvements
to their health, meaning this was a failed study, while the other side could argue that without this study being done, similar deterioration could have took place in the other 44% of patients.

### Rheumatoid Arthritis Exercise Methods
Rheumatoid Arthritis is a condition in which the joints in a persons body become inflamed. It is an unpredictable disease
as it can occur in any person of any age group. More than 44,000 people in Ireland have this affliction with 70% of them being women[14].
The  piece of literature which was researched in how to effectively deal with Rheumatoid Arthritis using exercise methods, is Evidence
For the Benefit of Aerobic and Strengthening Exercise in Rheumatoid Arthritis by Christina H. Stenström and Marian A. Minor[15].

The main research question put forward by the authors  of this paper are to investigate the evidence regarding the benefits of both aerobic and strengthening exercises in
Rheumatoid Arthritis and is there any truth to these benefits? The methodology technique used to accurately conduct this study were randomized controlled trials used to investigate the effects of exercise to improve
aerobic capacity and muscle strength in people diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis were searched. The search results produced 208 articles. Of which 30
of these articles reporting on 26 randomised controlled trials remained. These articles were broken down further into 17 papers with 15
randomized controlled trials remaining. It was from these articles where the final results would be determined. 

The exercises were performed twice weekly, with a maximum of twice daily in one particular study. Aerobic exercises had an intensity
level of being set from moderate to hard, meaning that the patients heart rate varied from 50-85%[16] of the maximum measured heart rate.
While the strengthening exercise programs were adjusted, starting with an intensity level of 30-50% and increasing to a maximum of 80%[17].
The studies concluded that in 5 cases there were improvements to aerobic capacity, while in 3 cases there was not, while 8 studies reported
muscle function increase after the strengthening exercises, whereas in 6 cases there was not. From the studies conducted there is more than enough
evidence to support the theory that aerobic and strengthening exercises benefit those with Rheumatoid Arthritis. As the majority of patents who took part in
research did show signs of improvement in both aerobic and muscle function capacities, specifically 62.5% in aerobic and 57.14% in strengthening exercises.
A negative of this paper is that most of the research conducted by the author is drawn from other third party sources and not studies done by the authors themselves, meaning
they could not validate themselves the questions being asked.

### Dealing With Depression
Studies show that many people who suffer with depression don't seek professional help. But why is this the case? The following paper;
Belief in Dealing with Depression Alone: Results From Community Surveys of Adolescents and Adults by Anthony F. Jorm, Clair M. Kelly, Annemarie
Wright, Ruth A. Parslow, Meredith G. Harris and Patrick D. McGorr[18] delves into this question on why is their a lack of treatment and
why is it better to deal with depression with outside help. The methodology used to conduct this research was a series of surveys sent which were sent out
to 3998 Australian adults, with 1001 receiving a vignette of a person with major depression, these vignettes were randomised so respondents would receive a
male or a female version. 1115 surveys were sent out to Australian adolescents, with 564 containing a vignette. Questions were also
asked regarding the vignette to the respondents of this survey. A second survey was also sent out to adolescents in the Melbourne region of 
Australia. There were 1207 of these surveys sent out. The respondents to these surveys were asked a series of questions regarding the vignette,
such as assessing the particular disorder shown, their beliefs about treatment and whether they felt if it was better to deal with depression alone.
From the data collected, responses regarding the question about dealing with depression alone were marked as helpful, harmful and other.

The results obtained from the adult survey indicated that 13.2% believed that it would be easier to deal with depression alone,
while 63.4% would believe it to be more harmful. Men believed that it would be more helpful to deal with it alone at 14.8% compared to women at
11.7% and less likely to be harmful at 56.8% compared to 69.6%. Also when asked what was wrong with the individual in the vignette,
the group that believed in dealing with depression alone was significantly less likely to correctly recognize depression than the group which thought this would have been
more harmful according to the studies done, with the results of these studies standing at 68% for harmful, and 53.6% for helpful. 
The results obtained from the adolescents survey were similar to the results obtained from the adults survey in regard to the question
whether dealing with depression alone was harmful or helpful. In the first adolescent survey, 12.7% of people believed that dealing with depression
alone was more helpful, while in the second survey 9.5% of people believed it was more helpful too deal with depression alone. 
Also similar to the adult survey was that in both adolescent surveys there was a difference between the genders opinions, with males believing that it was better to deal
with depression alone at 16.1% compared to females at 9.1% for survey one, and 11.7% compared to 7.7% in survey 2. Males were also less
likely to believe that it is harmful with 63.3% compared to females at 70.1% in survey 1, and 55.8% compared to 68.3% in survey 2.
When asked what was wrong with the individual in the vignette, the group that believed it was more helpful to deal with depression were less
likely to be able to recognize depression. With the results of survey 1 indicating; helpful at 41.4% and harmful at 61.6%, and a similar pattern appearing
in survey 2 with helpful at 38.2%, compared to harmful at 47.6%.

Judging from the results of these surveys it indicates that the majority of people do believe that dealing with depression alone does more harm than good.
The strong points of these studies is that they got their results from a large group of people, not only different genders, but of different age groups too.
This led to a more accurate answer whether or not people believed getting outside help is a better way of dealing with depression therefore answering
the question which in which the paper originally set out to answer. One of the weak points of this study is mentioned in the paper itself, which is that the surveys did not ask
why did the participants in the survey hold the beliefs that they did in regard to dealing with depression alone, or not alone? So people
citing this paper would not have an indication as to the reason why is dealing with depression alone, or not alone do more harm than good and vice versa.

### Exercise Training in Alzheimer's
Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that can cause a decline in a persons mental functions.
It is a disease which progressively gets worse over time the older someone who is diagnosed with the disease gets. It can
affect a persons memory, thinking, behaviour and language. Nearly 40,000 people in Ireland suffer from Alzheimer's disease[19].
A number of studies have also contributed Alzheimer's to a physical deterioration, reduced muscle mass, resulting in
a higher risk of falls and severe injuries[20]. The following journal; Exercise Training is Beneficial for Alzheimer's Patients
by E. Santana-Sosa, M. I. Barriopedro, L. M. López-Mojares, M. Pérez, A. Lucia[21] researches into how can resistance exercise and training
prevent these problems and lead to increased muscle mass and strength, along with higher endurance and fitness levels in Alzheimer patients,
therefore making it easier for people diagnosed with this disease to perform "activities of daily living". To conduct this study; 16
patients were chosen, 10 female and 6 male. They were assigned to either a training or a control group.

A series of tests were done on the patients including a senior fitness test, this test was used to evaluate the functional capacity
of the patients testing their muscle dynamic strength for the endurance of their legs. This was accomplished by doing a 30 second chair stand test.
The patients upper body was also tested, an arm curl test using 5 pound weights for women and 8 pound weights for men was used to accomplish this.
Flexibility of the upper and lower body was also tested using a chair sit-and-reach test and a back scratch test. Also tested were speed, agility,
endurance, balance while moving and aerobic endurance, this was done through an 8-foot-up-and-go exercise and a 2-minute-step-test. The intervention included
36 programmed training sessions, each 75 minutes, and done over a period of 12 weeks. Each session started with a 15 minute warm up period and a 15 minute cool down period.
Patients assigned to the control group did not perform in any physical activities.

No significant difference was found between either group at the start if the tests. By the end of the twelve weeks a significant difference was found for
post intervention values in both chair stand and arm curl tests, whereas no difference was found in the control group. No significant difference was found between either group
at the start of the lower and upper body flexibility test, and while no significant difference was found between the groups after the tests,
there was a significant time and interaction effect that existed. In the training group for the 8-foot-up-and-go and 2 minute step tests revealed that post intervention values were significantly lower and higher. The
final results also showed that post intervention training values were much improved in the training group as opposed to the control group when it came to performing
activities of daily living.

Overall it is no surprise that daily exercise can help reduce the effects of muscle deterioration as associated with Alzheimer's disease, and this study did a perfect job showing the effects of exercise over an extended period of time as shown by the significant 
improvements to the patients performance of activities of daily living according to the authors. This can lead to reduced injuries of patients with Alzheimer's when it comes to performing mundane tasks around their home,
especially if unsupervised. The authors also answered their original question on whether these daily exercises can help Alzheimer patients regain
muscle mass, while increasing the endurance and fitness levels, and the studies done proved this.

### Type 1 Diabetes Treatments
Type 1 diabetes is a metabolic disorder which tends to occur in childhood or early adult life.
In this form of diabetes little insulin is produced, which results in high blood sugar levels and it is required that it is
treated with insulin injections. There are an approximate 14-16,000 people in Ireland with type 1 diabetes which accounts for 10-15% of the total
diabetes population in Ireland. On top of this it is estimated that 2,750 of these people with this condition are under the age of 16[22]. The following
paper; Intensive Diabetes  Treatment and Cardiovascular Disease in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes by the Diabetes Control and Complications
Trial along with Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) Study Research Groups ask the question,
can intensive therapy aimed at achieving near normal levels of blood sugar reduce the risk of micro-vascular and neurological complications that come with with
type 1 diabetes. To see if this was possible 1441 patients ages 13-40 were chosen to take part in this study. These patients were randomly assigned
to intensive or conventional therapy. Intensive therapy consisted of three or more daily injections of insulin with dose adjustments based on the patients
glucose levels throughout the day. The conventional therapy group did not have to worry about glucose levels and therefor only had to inject two doses of insulin a day.

The studies showed that there was no significant difference between both the intensive treatment group and the conventional treatment group in terms of risk
when it came to contracting cardiovascular disease at the baseline of the experiment, but by the end of the tests the conventional treatment group came at a much higher risk of cardiovascular
disease with 98 cardiovascular disease events in 52 patients occurring compared to the 46 events in 31 patients for the intensive treatment.
Intensive treatment also reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease by 42%. The results concluded that the intensive treatment was beneficial for the group in the reduction
of cardiovascular disease in type 1 diabetes.

## Related Work
But how does all this relate to the work that will be done in the project? In this section of the literature review/research conducted
it will be discussed how these papers are relevant to the research in regards to the project, their success and effectiveness in answering the questions put forth, the similarities between
each paper, the advantages and disadvantages once compared, and a summary of all results.

### Relevance
Each research question deals with how these diseases can be dealt with using effective methods through exercise or self therapy that can be done
with the aids of research carried out by medical professionals or proven studies. This is relevant to the main application because the purpose of the application
is to create a hub where people suffering from these diseases can do their own research and set reminders on useful exercises and therapy methods
which they can carry out in a similar fashion to the studies shown above. Instead of ineffectively doing research, the research already conducted can be made available for the application, meaning
this information can be accessed in an easier way.

### Success/Effectiveness
Every single paper which has been reviewed posed a question which was then researched and studied by the authors and this
proved to be the basis for the papers. Each paper follows a formula to try and be as effective as possible in obtaining answers for the
research questions. Each researcher followed their own methods for obtaining results, such as conducting surveys, or performing exercises within
a specified group of people in an allocated amount of time. Overall each question which was asked at the start of every paper was solved through a series of studies and further research
conducted by the authors.

### Similarities
Each work does have certain similarities about the way in which the research was conducted, for example they all follow the same formula as previously mentioned.
They open up with a research question posed about an illness, a disease or a disorder. They go onto to then use a methodology to try and get the most accurate results
possible for their specified research. While each paper is similar in that they carried out their research by using a specified methodology,
not all papers used the same methodology when conducting their research. When compared, each paper has their own advantages, and disadvantages. Some papers
are much more in depth and cover their specific topic in much more detail than others. Papers which include a lack of depth for example when compared are the research papers on depression
which conducted surveys in an effort to answer the questions posed. The problem here is while the surveys can give you the opinons of
a large group of people, they often do not give the answer as to why these people feel the way in which they do. Another paper which could be said to lack
depth of the others, was the research done into arthritis, as the answers provided were done by tests not carried out by the authors themselves, but instead
was researched and cited by the authors.

### Summary of Results
Overall each paper did give a result which benefited the research that was conducted and led to valuable information being found when it comes to designing
an application based around fighting specific pains which a disease or an illness may cause. This research will lead to the application being more effective
and knowing exactly what exercises lead to benefits in their specific disease, this includes small walking exercises in patients with lung cancer can help to
fight the deterioration and improve the symptoms of the disease, aerobic and strengthening exercises in helping with muscle function
activities in fighting Rheumatoid Arthritis, talking to people about depression can be more helpful than fighting it alone, exercises in Alzheimer's disease can lead to improved
daily activity and lessening the chance of injuries related to the disease and intensive diabetes treatments can lead to a lesser chance of cardiovascular diseases. This information can lead to the application being more useful
to those in need of a hub where they can find out specific treatments for their disease and use the applications features to help them follow through with these treatments as much as possible.
