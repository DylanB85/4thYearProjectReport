\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Thanks to ... 

My project Supervisor Matt Smith. 

My friends Danut Hij, Owen Flannery and Karl Jones for being more than happy to lend a hand 
whenever they were available.

My mother and father for all the support they have given me throughout my college terms.

And finally, thank you to the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown for the resources provided to me throughout the years
and for furthering my education for now and hopefully in the future when I continue in fourth year.
